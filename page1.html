        <h2>Meet the Founders</h2>
        <p>
            We founded <strong>The Fidget Shop</strong> because we personally understood the power of focused movement. 
            In a world that constantly demands attention and stillness, we recognized that many people—ourselves included—
            find clarity, reduce anxiety, and improve concentration through simple, tactile interaction. 
            Our goal was to curate a collection of high-quality fidgets that not only serve a purpose but look and feel incredible,
            making focus accessible and stylish for everyone—from students to professionals.
        </p>
